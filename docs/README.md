# Design Notes & Experimental Observations

This directory contains supporting technical documentation created during the
development of the **ESP32 Secure MQTT Multi-State Smart Controller** project.

The documents focus on **design decisions, implementation flow, debugging
observations, and iterative development steps**, rather than end-user usage.

### ESP32 Secure MQTT Multi-State Smart Controller  
**Design Notes & Experimental Observations**

File:
`ESP32_3_State_Smart_Switch_MQTT_Project.pdf`

This document covers:
- Incremental development stages of the system
- Multi-state control logic and transitions
- MQTT topic design and message flow
- JSON payload structuring for dashboard-driven control
- Mapping of dashboard UI elements to hardware behavior
- Bidirectional control via MQTT and serial interface
- Hardware interfacing considerations (GPIO logic levels, signal conditioning)
- Practical debugging observations and system behavior

The document reflects an **R&D-focused embedded systems implementation**,
capturing both intermediate experiments and final design decisions.

## 🧪 Scope & Intent

These notes were authored as part of an **exploratory embedded systems R&D effort**
to evaluate secure MQTT-based control mechanisms on ESP32.

They are shared here for:
- Technical reference
- Design insight
- Learning and discussion purposes

They are **not intended as a deployment manual or production specification**.

## 🔄 Status

- ✔ Functional implementation validated through testing
- 🛠 Ongoing cleanup and documentation refinement
